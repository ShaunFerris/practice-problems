'''
Implementation of the sieve of Erastothenes, a classical 
method for determining if a number is prime or not.
'''
from math import isqrt #this is just a floor sqrt function

'''
Solution one:
Basic seive, with the 6k +/- 1 optimization, meaning that 
all primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1, where k 
is any integer greater than 0. Other more complex 
implementations are much faster for larger n.
